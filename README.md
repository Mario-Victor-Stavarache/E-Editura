# E-Editura
This is one of my first projects that I had to put together in my first year as a student. It covers the Object-Oriented-Programming principles that were taught to us in the second semester in our first year as students at the College of Mathematics and Computer Sciences. It resembles an electronic book shop, like e-book &lt;3

The interface of the project is a bsic one, nothing to really catch your eye like a fully developed app/platform, plus its written in Romanian as it should have been for presenting my project to my teacher. :)

I will follow up shortly with another version of this project/app with a more interesting, not-so-basic interface and also translated in English!! =D
